## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Combo` condition.
- Logging for binding.
- `ActionEventKinds` bitmask to store triggered events since the last update. Accessible via `ActionData::event_kinds`.
- `ActionsData::insert_action`.

### Changed

- Remove world access from conditions and modifiers. This means that you no longer can write game-specific conditions or modifiers. But it's much nicer (and faster) to just do it in observers instead.
- Values from `Input` are now converted to the action-level dimension only after applying all input-level modifiers and conditions. This allows things like mapping the Y-axis of `ActionValue::Axis2D` into an action with `ActionValueDim::Axis1D`.
- Rename `ActionBind::with_axis2d` into `ActionBind::with_xy_axis`.
- Rename `ScaleByDelta` into `DeltaScale`.
- Rename `Released` into `Release`.
- Rename `Pressed` into `Press`.
- Rename `BlockedBy` into `BlockBy`.
- Rename `Scalar` into `Scale`.
- Replace `SmoothDelta` with `LerpDelta` that does only linear interpolation. Using easing functions for inputs doesn't make much sense.
- Modifiers are now allowed to change passed value dimensions.
- All built-in modifiers now handle values of any dimention.
- Replace `with_held_timer` with `relative_speed` that just accepts a boolean.
- Rename `HeldTimer` into `ConditionTimer`.
- Use Use `trace!` instead of `debug!` for triggered events.

### Removed

- `ignore_incompatible!` since no longer needed.
- `SwizzleAxis::XXX`, `SwizzleAxis::YYY` and `SwizzleAxis::ZZZ`. They encourage a bad pattern of defining actions with duplicate data. Duplicate axes inside the trigger if needed.
